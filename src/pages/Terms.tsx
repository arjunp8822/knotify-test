        <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
          The advertising fees payable to Knotify pursuant to these Terms and
          Conditions are the quoted rates advised to you. We reserve the right
          to increase our fees and we will notify you of any fee increases.
          Advertising Fees are inclusive of GST. You agree to place a Directory
          Listing with Knotify on the Website for a 12 month period (Initial
          Term), regardless of payment terms extended. By committing to Knotify
          directory advertising you commit to the full 12 months advertising
          fees. Knotify will provide you with a tax invoice for the advertising
          fees plus applicable GST when an advertising package is agreed upon.
          You must pay the first payments (subject to payment term agreed)
          before your advertising goes online. If more than one payment is
          required during the initial term, all future payments must be secured
          with a valid credit card or direct debit. If you are eligible for a
          monthly payment term you will be put onto a "Perpetual" contract.
          After the Initial Term, your agreement with us will continue on as a
          month by month agreement. If your account is overdue we have the right
          to take your ad offline until we have received all outstanding moneys.
          If you commit an act of bankruptcy, become insolvent, have a receiver
          or administrator or liquidator or manager appointed over you or any of
          your assets or if you resolve to wind up your company, then Knotify
          may (in its absolute discretion): take proceedings against you to
          recover any overdue amount; recover from you all costs in relation to
          any action taken against you by Knotify to recover overdue amounts,

        <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
          Knotify may terminate your Directory Listing and remove your Directory
          Listing from the Website at any time during the Initial Term and for
          any reason. Knotify is not obliged to provide you with reasons for
          terminating your Directory Listing. If Knotify terminates your
          Directory Listing during the Initial Term and you have paid the
          advertising fees upfront and are otherwise not in breach of these
          Terms and Conditions, Knotify will refund you a pro rata portion of
          the advertising fees applicable to the unused part of the Initial
          Term. If Knotify terminates your Directory Listing either during or
          after the Initial Term, and you pay the advertising fees by direct
          debit, Knotify will cancel your direct debit arrangements provided you
          are up to date with payment of all advertising fees. If there are any
          amounts owing to Knotify at the date of termination, you authorise
          Knotify to direct debit all overdue amounts from your nominated
          account. If Knotify removes your Directory Listing from the Website
          during the Initial Term pursuant to clause 5 of these Terms and
          Conditions, you agree that you will not be entitled to a refund of any
          amounts paid in respect of the Directory Listing during the Initial
          Term.

          Term and you have paid the advertising fees upfront, you will not be
          entitled to a refund of any amounts paid in respect of the Directory
          Listing during the Initial Term. This also relates to future annual
          subscriptions. If you cancel your Directory Listing with Knotify
          during the Initial Term, the advertising fees payable by you for the
          unused part of the Initial Term will become immediately due and
          payable. This also relates to future annual subscriptions. After the
          expiry of the Initial Term, if you are on a "Perpetual" contract you
          may withdraw your Directory Listing at any time by following our
          cancellation process, which includes speaking with a team member,
          verifying your identity and completing a cancellation form. 30 days
          after the receipt of your completed form, your Knotify Directory
          Listing will be removed from the Website and any payments due during

          Directory Listing during the Initial Term. Knotify reserves the right
          to amend, move or reposition your Directory Listing or change the
          Website at any time. Knotify will use its reasonable endeavours to
          give you advance notice of any material changes that it makes to the
          Website. You agree that you must pay all advertising fees even where:
          your Directory Listing (or part of it) is not published due to a
          breach of these Terms and Conditions by you; your Directory Listing
          (or any part of it) is not published due to your failure to provide
          sufficient artwork or instructions; the format or placement of the
          Directory Listing has been varied by Knotify; or you believe your
          Directory Listing has not resulted in the number of enquiries you
          expected to receive as a result of the Directory Listing on the
          Website.
