      "Sydneysiders expect a certain level of excellence when it comes to events in and around the CBD, and when you’re a coastal city, waterfront venues are in high demand. That’s certainly the case for Coogee Bay Hotel, which boasts a prime piece of real estate right on the beach and just 20 minutes from the city centre.\n\nThe team at Coogee Bay Hotel pride themselves on delivering an exceptional event experience for every occasion, be that a milestone birthday, a corporate function, or your dream wedding. With a venue layout that flows from room to room, your guests will be able to move through the space organically. This is particularly exciting for clients who plan to set up multiple stations such as corporate stalls, food carts and entertainers, or breakout areas to mingle and relax.\n\nThe two rooms – the Seaview Room and the Seabreeze Room – have access to a spacious balcony that looks out across the beach and the ocean. The spaces feel coastal and elegant, with floor-to-ceiling windows and light tones and furnishings inviting the sunbleached coastline into the venue’s aesthetic.\n\nThe Coogee Bay Hotel is a 4-star boutique hotel, so your guests have access to 74 beautifully appointed rooms and suites. Perfect for wedding eve and night, multi-day conferences, or out-of-towners who don’t fancy a late-night drive home, you have a choice of rooms from the boutique or Coogee Bay style.",

      "Events at Chateau Elan at The Vintage evoke a sense of old-school grandeur in the heart of the Hunter Valley. The building itself is reminiscent of an exclusive mansion, and Chateau Elan is home to The Vintage, a gorgeous Greg Norman-designed golf course with members flocking to hit the greens every day.\n\nThe golf course makes Chateau Elan a highly sought after venue for social events, but for those more interested in taking photos on the green than making putts, Chateau Elan is a stunning wedding venue. Take advantage of the manicured lawns and lush gardens by erecting a marquee on the grass, or host your guests inside amongst the glamorous gold and black finishes.\n\nStay a few nights in one of the many luxury suites and rooms, including a deluxe spa suite, and enjoy a glass of wine from one of many neighbouring Hunter Valley wineries. You can enjoy a meal from either of the two onsite restaurants; casual fare from Spike Bar, or a formal feast from Legends Grill. Keen to relax? Play a few holes, or spoil yourself with a treatment at the award-winning Hunter Valley Day Spa.",
